# All created towns are listed here in the following format:
#
# TownName:
#   tax: 10
#
# Tax is set automatically from the config.yml, though can be edited
# via the "/ac taxset [town] [percent]" command.
#
# Certain items can also be specified to have a different price,
# stock, replenish time or replenish amount by using the
# "/ac priceset [town] [item] [price] (stock) (replenish time) (replenish amount)" command.
# Custom items will be listed in the following format, overwriting the defaults for this town:
#
# TownName:
#   tax: 10
#   items:
#     coal:
#       price: 100
#       maxstock: 50
#       replenishtime: 100
#       replenishamount: 10
#     book:
#       price: 500
#       maxstock: 1
#
# In the above example, coal has been fully set up, while only the price and stock level of
# books has been specified. In this case, books will continue to use the replenishtime and
# replenishamount defaults set in the basePrice.yml file.
#
# When a vendor sign is created and used for the first time, the "curstock" value is created.
# This defaults to the maxstock setting and will rise and fall depending on player purchases
# and sales. You can use this value to manually set current stock, or use the following command:
# "/ac stockset [town] [item] [stock]"
