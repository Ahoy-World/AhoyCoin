AhoyCoin is an plugin that utilises Vault to provide Minecraft Bukkit servers with a dynamic, easily-changeable economy that flows along with its player base. A few features would include individual towns / traders, taxes, dynamically-replenishing stock levels and 'projects', allowing players to contribute to server-wide buildings.
